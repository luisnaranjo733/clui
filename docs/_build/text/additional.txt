clui was developed on Ubuntu Linux Precise Pangolin (12.04) **and**
Mac OS Lion

Colorama claims to be cross platform. I have yet to test it.

It is bundled with clui, under the same license.

Glossary
========

callables
   Callables in python are either function objects, or class objects.

clui
   A clui is an abbreviation for Command Line User Interface

condition
   A value (string, integer, float) that you can pass to clui for
   condition tests.

   To break the main loop of the clui, have a condition test return a
   value that is not the condition.

   If you want it to continue, then return the condition.

   The condition defaults to True.

condition tests
   Condition tests are used to regulate the loopage of the program, by
   returning, or not returning, the set condition.

exit callables
   A list of callables that are called right before the program exits,
   due to an exit word being matched to the user input.

exit words
   A list of regex patterns that are used to match to the user input.

   If a match is found, exit_callables (if any) are called, the
   exit_message (if present) is displayed, and the clui is broken.
